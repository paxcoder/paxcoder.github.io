<p>hey, people.
I begun translating relan to Polish.<br>
my frustration is with html, I hate writing it.<br>
but I need a website, and good hosting is paid.
so, stuck on that for now.
there will be Polish version of this website, tomorrow.<br>
by the way, there will be new post, about audio clipping in new utm vm, that I made, and how did I fixed it.
